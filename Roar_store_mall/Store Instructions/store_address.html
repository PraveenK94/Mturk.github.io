    <p><strong><b>Filling Address line 1 &amp; 2: (Incorrect capturing of Address line 1 and 2 would result in lower quality) </b></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>a) Capture street number &amp; name in Address line 1 field. In the above example for 5th Avenue Mall- 320 W 5TH Avenue would be captured in Address line 1</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>b) Capture the suite number or store number or building number in &lsquo;address line 2&rsquo;.In the above example for 5th Avenue Mall &ldquo;#148&rdquo; would be in Address line 2. If no suite number is provided, then &lsquo;address line 2&rsquo; can be left blank.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong><b>Note:</b> There is no need of capturing City/ State / Zipcode in Address line 1 &amp; 2.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong><b style="color: red;">While collecting the Address lines from official store website &quot; Capturing of city name , state name and zipcode is not required&quot;, collect only the street names in address line 1 and suite numbers in &quot;address line 2&quot;. For ex (&quot;6800 OXON HILL ROAD SPC 855&quot; , consider &quot;6800 OXON HILL ROAD - address line 1&quot; &amp; &quot;SPC 855 - address line 2&quot; and address line 3 can be left blank. In few cases the address line 2 will be like this &quot;SPC 800&quot;/ &quot;STE E&quot;/&quot;BLDG 10&quot;/&quot;Unit 20&quot;, also do not consider the range number which is provided before the street name as &quot;suite number&quot;. </b></strong></p>
