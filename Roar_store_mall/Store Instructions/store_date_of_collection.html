    <p><strong><b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTION OF DATE AND OPERATING HOURâ€™S OF STORE</b></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>a) From the official store website and capture the store&#39;s operating hours for each day of the week in AM/ PM format.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong><b style="color: red;">Note : If the timings are mentioned as &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;NA&rdquo; select the same from the dropdown.</b></strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>b) Hours are generally listed under &ldquo;Hours&rdquo; sections. If not, Hours can also be found in either About Us or Contact Us page.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>c) Also, sometimes store websites surface two sets of operating hours: hours this week and Regular hours. When you see multiple sets of hours, you should use Regular Hours.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>d) Collect the day wise operating hours data into the output field below . Also include &ldquo;Date of collection&rdquo; (Date on which the operating hours are collected), before hours are listed.</strong></p>
